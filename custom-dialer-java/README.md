# java-custom-dialer
This is a simple dialer app that has all the basic features needed to understand how to use the InCallService APIs to replace the default dialer app. Since Android 10 the only way to programmatically accept or reject incoming calls is using the InCallService APIs.

This App handles both incoming and outgoing calls when it's given the permission to be the default calling app.
